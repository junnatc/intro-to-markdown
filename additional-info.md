# How to write an HTML Boilerpate

In HTML, the structure of its starter code is called a boilerplate. This structure is vital in making any program that includes HTML.

## Step 1. Create file in Terminal

Use the terminal command **mkdir Your file name**, to create a directory. Once you do that use the cd command to switch into that directory.

*As a developer, using terminal is a everyday practice in creating files and storing/replacing data within your repositories whether it's internally from your computer or through github.*

## Step 2. Create your HTML file in the directory made

Use the terminal command **touch index.html** to create your HTML file. Once you do that, use the terminal command code . to open your code editor.

## Step 3. Open your index.html file, *type !* and hit enter

Once you hit enter you should automatically have your boilerplate made for you.

## Step 4. Make indentation is accurate

Indentation is very important when coding as it holds a certain hierchary for certain elements.
